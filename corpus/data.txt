 <sports> WUHAN: World number one Serena Williams announced Thursday her withdrawal from next week's China Open in Beijing and the WTA Finals in Singapore ending her season    I am taking a proactive step and withdrawing from tournaments in Beijing and Singapore to properly address my health and take the time to heal the 21- time Grand Slam winner said in a statement    The China Open first tweeted the announcement but the WTA has not confirmed Williams' withdrawal    Williams has not played since she lost in the semifinals of the US Open to Italy's Roberta Vinci one of the most shocking upsets in tennis history    It's no secret I've played injured most of the year -- whether it was my elbow my knee or in the finals moments after a certain match in Flushing my heart Williams said    William's coach Patrick Mouratoglou told ESPN earlier this week that she was intensely disappointed after missing out on a fifth consecutive Grand Slam crown and hinted that she may withdraw from the remaining tournaments of the season </sports> <sports> LONDON: Eight members of Iran's national women's football team are actually men awaiting sex change operations reports have claimed    A report in the 'Daily Telegraph' quoted an Iranian football official revealing the bizarre development Iran's national football association was accused of being unethical for knowingly fielding eight men in its women's team    (Eight players) have been playing with Iran's female team without completing sex change operations Mojtabi Sharifi an official close to the Iranian league told an Iranian news website which has been picked up by the British newspapers    The report said that Iranian authorities ordered gender testing of the entire national squad and leading league players on Wednesday The names of the players thought to be male were not revealed    The Iranian women's team play in hijab headscarfs long-sleeved tops and tracksuit bottoms    In 2014 the country's football governing body introduced random checks after it was revealed that four national team players were either men who had not completed sex change operations or were suffering from sexual development disorders according to the newspaper    In 2010 doubts were raised about the gender of the team's goalkeeper    The newspaper said that gender change operations are legal in Iran though there are strict rules governing sexual morality which forbid homosexuality and pre-marital sex It also said that the full procedure of 'sex change' takes up to two years before the full gender transformation is completed    Football is highly popular among many Iranian women despite religious rules that bar them from entering stadiums to watch matches between male teams    The Iranian national team is ranked 59th in the world and 13th in Asia </sports> <politics>  PATNA/GAYA: The apparently unwarranted statement of a BJP leader claiming control over the Election Commission brought the Commission into avoidable controversy and on its part the Commission too has taken actions that have caused concern to the proponents of fair election    As some of the decisions of the Commission appear to be at variance with established practices and conventions questions are being asked if Nasim Zaidi the CEC would prove equal to the challenges and fit in TN Seshan's shoes    It was TN Seshan who in the 1990s established the authority of the Commission and introduced innovative measures to conduct fair elections Seshan's successors have by and large maintained the tradition    But some decisions of the Zaidi led Commission have not gone down well with observers of the Bihar political scene Such decisions include the ban imposed on the deployment of Bihar police personnel As per the EC order Bihar police personnel would not be deployed at any of the nearly 63000 polling stations    All these polling stations would be manned by members of the Central forces Elections for the 243 seats of the Bihar Assembly are to be held in five phases between 12 October and 5 November'2015 and Counting of votes is scheduled for 8 November    According to MA Kazmi a retired IPS of the Bihar cadre the decision to ban Bihar cops from polling stations was unfortunate to the extent that it either means that the Bihar cops are inefficient or partisan or both which was not true    Bihar police was like any other police force strengths and weaknesses included and as such the decision to keep Bihar police personnel away from the polling stations was improper and unfair The retired IPS hoped that the EC will review the decision Such a decision will have a long term demoralising effect on the Bihar police However Kazmi did not attribute motives and said that may be the decision was taken in haste    The Commission will enhance its own stature if it withdraws the order said Kazmi There is no guarantee that the Central forces will do better said the retired IPS Like the Ceaser's proverbial wife the EC should be above suspicion he added    Besides the decision to keep Bihar cops away from polling stations on the crucial poll day EC's handling of the deputation of senior officials including Principal Home Secretsry DMs and SPs has also come in for criticism The convention has been to put officers in key positions from a three name panel recommended by the state govt    This practice was introduced by TN Seshan and his successors religiously followed it But in the case of 2015 Bihar Assembly election the EC in violation of the convention suo motto made direct deputations to key positions Such a departure from established practice was bound to cause scepticism This could easily have been avoided feel Bihar watchers    According to former MP Shivanand Tiwary govt plays an important role in appointments to constitutional positions and as such it would be naive to expect complete neutrality from the occupants of constitutional positions like the chief election commissioner But such positions should not be blatantly misused he said Such appointees in the past too have not always conducted themselves in a fair and transparent manner said Tiwary </politics> <politics> SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Saturday that an attack in Sydney in which a 15-year-old gunman shot dead a civilian police employee appeared to have been an act of terrorism    Police said little was known about the unidentified teen who was shot dead in an exchange of fire with officers after he killed finance worker Curtis Cheng at close range outside the force's headquarters in western Sydney on Friday    Reports said that the youth who police said was of Iraqi-Kurdish background and had been born in Iran had been shouting religious slogans before shooting Cheng in the back of the head    Turnbull called on Australians to go about their lives as usual as they begin a long weekend in which two major sporting finals will be held in Sydney and Melbourne    This appears to have been an act of politically motivated violence so at this stage it appears to have been an act of terrorism It is a shocking crime the prime minister said in Melbourne    It was a cold-blooded murder targeting the New South Wales Police Service It was doubly shocking because it was perpetrated by a 15-year-old boy    And it underlines the importance of families communities leaders being very aware of whether young people are becoming radicalized he said    Andrew Scipione the police commissioner for the state of New South Wales of which Sydney is the capital told reporters that investigators were a long way from establishing what exactly prompted the attack adding that the boy had no criminal history    Australia has stepped up its efforts in countering the risk of extremist attacks lifting its terror threat alert to high a year ago and Scipione said police were aware they could be targeted    In September 2014 Melbourne police shot dead a known terror suspect who stabbed two officers just one day after the Islamic State group called for Muslims to indiscriminately kill Australians    And in December of that year Iranian-born self-styled cleric Man Haron Monis and two hostages were killed following a 17-hour siege at a central Sydney cafe    Scipione said early indications were that the boy was acting alone and police had no warning of any attack He said they were not sure whether Cheng was targeted simply because he had left the police building    We may never know that But he was certainly targeted in terms of the shooting It was a direct shooting he said    New South Wales state Premier Mike Baird said he believed that the lives of others had been saved by the quick actions of police at the scene    There's no doubt that this tragedy will echo around the world as people try and understand how someone so young could commit such a hideous crime Baird said adding that his first reaction to the event had been of shock    But he added: We cannot let actions such as this divide us We cannot let hate overtake us We have to come together    Australia like other countries around the world has been grappling with the complex issue of the radicalisation of young people and Turnbull said it was important to understand the critical importance of collaboration with the Muslim community at this time    We must not vilify or blame the entire Muslim community with the actions of what is in truth a very very small percentage of violent extremist individuals the prime minister said    The Muslim community are our absolutely necessary partners in combating this type of violent extremism  </politics>

 <sports> NEW YORK: Top FIFA sponsors joined forces to demand Sepp Blatter's immediate resignation on Friday dealing a fresh blow to the scandal-tainted world football chief even as he vowed to cling to power    In separate statements issued one week after criminal proceedings were launched against Blatter in Switzerland Coca-Cola McDonald's Visa and Budweiser all called on the 79-year-old to step down    It marked the first time that FIFA's powerful financial backers -- who together have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the organization through deals spanning decades -- had called explicitly for Blatter to resign    In a statement issued by his US lawyer in reaction to the sponsor demands Blatter defiantly vowed to remain in office    But the US-based sponsors said Blatter's position was now untenable in the wake of the corruption scandal that has plunged world football into it's worst-ever crisis    For the benefit of the game The Coca-Cola Company is calling for FIFA president Joseph Blatter to step down immediately so that a credible and sustainable reform process can begin in earnest the soft-drinks giant said    Every day that passes the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach    McDonald's said the recent wave of headlines meant that Blatter who had vowed to remain in the post until the election of his successor early next year could not continue    The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership the US fast-food leader said    We believe it would be in the best interest of the game for FIFA president Sepp Blatter to step down immediately so that the reform process can proceed with the credibility that is needed    Visa meanwhile cast doubt on Blatter's ability to clean up the swamp of sleaze in which FIFA is mired    We believe no meaningful reform can be made under FIFA's existing leadership And given the events of last week it's clear it would be in the best interests of FIFA and the sport for Sepp Blatter to step down immediately Visa said    Anheuser-Busch InBev whose Budweiser beer has been a FIFA sponsor since the 1980s also joined the calls saying Blatter's continued presence was an obstacle in the reform process    The sponsor comments were in stark contrast to previous carefully-worded statements on the corruption scandal none of which mentioned Blatter by name    It was not clear whether FIFA top sponsors based outside the United States including Hyundai Adidas and Gazprom would follow suit    Blatter's New York attorney Richard Cullen swiftly issued a statement saying the FIFA chief had no plans to relinquish his position    Blatter believes firmly that his leaving office now would not be in the best interest of FIFA nor would it advance the process of reform and therefore he will not resign it said    A FIFA spokeswoman declined to comment on the sponsor's demands which create a fresh headache for Blatter as he attempts to remain in office    English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke a long-time critic of Blatter said the sponsor calls marked the end of the road for the FIFA chief    I think this is a game-changer It doesn't matter what Mr Blatter says now -- if the people who pay for FIFA want a change they will get a change Dyke said in London    For those of us who want fundamental change this is good news    Swiss prosecutors say Blatter is the target of a probe into criminal mismanagement at FIFA focusing on a 2005 television rights sale to the Caribbean Football Union and a payment of two million Swiss francs ($2 million) made in 2011 to European football chief Michel Platini the frontrunner to succeed him    Both Blatter and Platini have strongly denied any wrongdoing    News that criminal proceedings had been opened against Blatter last week sent fresh shocks through the football world deepening the crisis that erupted in May when the US Justice Department indicted 14 people over bribery in football deals worth more than $150 million dating back to 1991    Aside from an open criminal file against its president nine FIFA officials have been charged in the United States    Blatter's former right-hand man secretary general Jerome Valcke was suspended last month over allegations that he was aware of a black market ticket scheme surrounding the 2014 World Cup Valcke denied the claims  </sports>

short format is what makes it exciting and unpredictable  One small lapse and the team may have to pay the ultimate price  On the other hand  an individual piece of brilliance has the tendency to turn the game on its head  In this format  no score in enough and not even a hard-hitting century can guarantee you win    The opening game between India and South Africa at Dharamshala proved all that has been mentioned above  Both teams had their moments  It just so happened that one team made the most of it and the other didn't  And the one that did  emerged victorious  In the end  it all came down to a fighting effort from JP Duminy  their highest run-scorer in this format  and the link that keeps South Africa's middle order connected   But it wasn't before a strong base was set at the top by two of the most prolific batsmen in Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers  Whereas credit must go to India for the way they hit South Africa right in their weak spot  Every time India got rid of their best top-order batsman  that's when the Proteas exposed their vulnerability  They did that this time around as well  but just couldn't carry it forward  In other words  South Africa did not choke   India couldn't finish it off after starting well  South Africa's batting on the other hand  made amends with a performance not many expected them to dish out after they went down to India A few days back at the Palam Air Force Ground on Monday  As a matter of fact  they even arrived in the city late  underwent just one intense practice session as compared to India's four    Call it tactical blunders or whatever  India had quite a few loose ends during the game  If Shikhar Dhawan had arrived just a day before the game  he should have been rested  Instead  Ajinkya Rahane could have been brought in to open the batting  After all  despite all that has been said of his abilities to rotate strike  the fact remains that as long as a batsman is technically sound  he can prosper in any given situation   Also  Rahane made his debut opening for India and carried it forward for some time  Even in the absence of Rohit Sharma  who had fractured his finger  he was a good bet at the top and forged important partnerships with Dhawan in two limited-overs series against England and West Indies the year before    But MS Dhoni opts for Ambati Rayudu  and in his first international innings after the tour of Zimbabwe  the batsman is run out off the very first ball courtesy a horrible mix up with his captain  The Indian skipper replaces someone who he thinks can't rotate strike with a player who he doesn't give strike to - hark back to the T20 game against England last year  Rahane has said time and again that he is open to batting anywhere  so him not making the cut is questionable to a certain extent   The biggest worry for India though  remains the inability to get a move on in the end overs  From a formidable 158 for 1 and almost five overs left to go  India managed to make 199  Take out MS Dhoni's six off the last ball and it reads 193  Scores such as this have been chased over the years and with the ground being small and the amount of dew getting thicker  India couldn't have been breathing easy  Dhoni too has lately struggled to time the ball  something that has hurt the Indian team closing out their innings on a high   While their fast bowlers did not fare much better than their South Africans counterpart on a surface packed with runs and an outfield heavy with dew  the spinners looked like threatening the SA batsmen  They were cruising along before Axar Patel stemmed the flow of runs  Giving him company was Ravichandran Ashwin  who is fast becoming an irreplaceable asset to the Indian bowling unit in all formats  However  Dhoni decided to bowl Ashwin out  and with just one spinner to deal with  Duminy chanced his arms to the left-armer and took him for 22 runs - clearly the over that won South Africa the match    India were just beginning to squeeze in good overs  before three deliveries  all of which sailed over the fence  turned the tide towards du Plessis' side    Speaking of which  you tend to realise the importance of strategic practice  South Africa took every possible measure they could do during their practice session in Dharamshala  They batted and fielded with a wet ball  something that Faf du Plessis paid high regards to  So when their batsmen raced through in the first six overs  it came as no surprise  Amla and De Villiers set the base and Duminy  playing only his second match - any form of cricket for that matter - in over two months  continued to prove his worth in this format   Still early days in the series  but no better time to get a few boxes ticked as early as possible   </sports>

years  Modi will sign a strategic partnership agreement with Singapore when he visits the country in November this year Modi is looking to expand economic ties with both UAE and Singapore as he seeks more foreign capital to invest in infrastructure  One of the big takeaways from Modi's visit to UAE in August  according to the government  was the decision by UAE and India to together raise $ 75 billion for investment in railway  port and road projects in India   PM Modi wants Africa as partner in fight against terrorism UAE's decision to give land in Abu Dhabi for construction of a Hindu temple was touted as another achievement by Modi himself  However  it was the manner in which UAE strongly condemned state-sponsored terrorism that was seen as the biggest gain from the visit  seen as it was a snub to Pakistan    Modi also looks at Singapore as an important partner for some of his initiatives like smart city and is eager to elevate the relationship to a strategic partnership    The Africa summit will happen in the middle of the Bihar elections but that has not prevented Modi from involving himself intricately into the preparations for the event which will see the presence of top

 <sports> NEW YORK: Top FIFA sponsors joined forces to demand Sepp Blatter's immediate resignation on Friday  dealing a fresh blow to the scandal-tainted world football chief even as he vowed to cling to power     In separate statements issued one week after criminal proceedings were launched against Blatter in Switzerland  Coca-Cola  McDonald's  Visa and Budweiser all called on the 79-year-old to step down     It marked the first time that FIFA's powerful financial backers -- who together have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the organization through deals spanning decades -- had called explicitly for Blatter to resign     In a statement issued by his US lawyer in reaction to the sponsor demands  Blatter defiantly vowed to remain in office     But the US-based sponsors said Blatter's position was now untenable in the wake of the corruption scandal that has plunged world football into it's worst-ever crisis      For the benefit of the game  The Coca-Cola Company is calling for FIFA president Joseph Blatter to step down immediately so that a credible and sustainable reform process can begin in earnest   the soft-drinks giant said      Every day that passes  the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish  FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform  and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach      McDonald's said the recent wave of headlines meant that Blatter  who had vowed to remain in the post until the election of his successor early next year  could not continue      The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership   the US fast-food leader said      We believe it would be in the best interest of the game for FIFA president Sepp Blatter to step down immediately so that the reform process can proceed with the credibility that is needed      Visa meanwhile cast doubt on Blatter's ability to clean up the swamp of sleaze in which FIFA is mired      We believe no meaningful reform can be made under FIFA's existing leadership  And given the events of last week  it's clear it would be in the best interests of FIFA and the sport for Sepp Blatter to step down immediately   Visa said     Anheuser-Busch InBev  whose Budweiser beer has been a FIFA sponsor since the 1980s  also joined the calls  saying Blatter's continued presence was  an obstacle in the reform process      The sponsor comments were in stark contrast to previous  carefully-worded statements on the corruption scandal  none of which mentioned Blatter by name     It was not clear whether FIFA top sponsors based outside the United States  including Hyundai  Adidas and Gazprom would follow suit     Blatter's New York attorney Richard Cullen swiftly issued a statement saying the FIFA chief had no plans to relinquish his position     Blatter  believes firmly that his leaving office now would not be in the best interest of FIFA nor would it advance the process of reform and therefore  he will not resign   it said     A FIFA spokeswoman declined to comment on the sponsor's demands  which create a fresh headache for Blatter as he attempts to remain in office     English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke  a long-time critic of Blatter  said the sponsor calls marked the end of the road for the FIFA chief      I think this is a game-changer  It doesn't matter what Mr  Blatter says now -- if the people who pay for FIFA want a change they will get a change   Dyke said in London      For those of us who want fundamental change  this is good news      Swiss prosecutors say Blatter is the target of a probe into  criminal mismanagement  at FIFA  focusing on a 2005 television rights sale to the Caribbean Football Union and a payment of two million Swiss francs $2 million made in 2011 to European football chief Michel Platini  the frontrunner to succeed him     Both Blatter and Platini have strongly denied any wrongdoing     News that criminal proceedings had been opened against Blatter last week sent fresh shocks through the football world  deepening the crisis that erupted in May  when the US Justice Department indicted 14 people over bribery in football deals worth more than $150 million dating back to 1991     Aside from an open criminal file against its president  nine FIFA officials have been charged in the United States     Blatter's former right-hand man  secretary general Jerome Valcke was suspended last month over allegations that he was aware of a black market ticket scheme surrounding the 2014 World Cup  Valcke denied the claims   </sports> <tech> Giving public transport the cold shoulder  working professionals travelling from Ghaziabad and Meerut to Noida are carpooling to work  thanks to the many ride-sharing apps launched recently     Young working professionals living in Meerut or Ghaziabad and working in Noida have had their fair share of bus and train rides  as they commute every day from home to work and back  And no matter how back-breaking the bus rides are  you can't help but grin and bear it  After all  who can afford to spend half the salary on cabs  and that too at a beginner's pay  But thanks to a number of ride-sharing and car-rental apps and online portals  many commuters are giving bus journeys a miss and carpooling to work     All they have to do is post about their trip on these online forums  and others looking to share the ride can contact the person directly  Ride-sharing services say that the trend is fast catching up among Noida's working lot     Carpooling works best for long distance journeys    While carpooling and ride-sharing is not new as a concept  it has seen a new lease of life with the launch of these services that enable users to connect online     An official from Ridingo  which was launched in February this year  says   In terms of usage of ride-sharing services  the satellite towns of NCR almost rival Delhi  This is because of the lack of proper public transport facilities in the cities  Someone travelling to Ghaziabad from Noida  after a long day at work  would want his/her journey to be comfortable - something that you can't get in inter-city buses  So  young office-goers are increasingly opting to share car rides with others travelling on the same route  And they can easily connect to other individuals via ride-sharing apps and websites  A car journey is much more convenient than a bus ride  especially for long distances      Greg Moran  CEO and co-founder  Zoomcar  says   In India  ride sharing is still largely in its infancy but an increasing number of commuters going to a similar end location have started opting for car-pooling instead of public transport now  It has a particular relevance for the NCR region given that young professionals in satellite towns travel long distances on a daily basis for work  We have seen that while car-pooling was always a viable option in the region  many commuters stayed away as they did not know how to connect to these individuals  These services have now given them the required platform  The trend is even helping allied services like self-drive rentals where one can hire a car for a day and then share a ride      Noida commuters travel to Chandigarh  Jaipur and West UP cities Data from ride-sharing services shows that the most visited destinations by commuters from Noida are Chandigarh  Jaipur and West UP cities such as Agra and Meerut  They say that most of these are professionals returning to their hometowns over weekends and vacations  while others are daily commuters     Raghav Gupta  India country manager  BlaBlaCar  says   People are making frequent trips to their hometowns at affordable prices through ride-sharing in this region  This service benefits everyone who needs to travel by helping them cut costs  reduce traffic congestion and minimize their carbon footprint  while meeting like-minded people  For the occasional or weekly travellers  the most travelled cities from Noida are Chandigarh  Jaipur  Agra  Dehradun  and Meerut  Daily commuters usually go to nearby cities like Meerut and Ghaziabad      Carpooling is reliable  cheaper and comfortable: Commuters     Regular commuters say that in the absence of reliable and cheap means of transportation in the region  carpooling is a natural option  The only reason it has picked up now despite being a viable option for several years is that people have started using apps as the platform they need to meet people they can carpool with     Rajesh Varma  who travels from Ghaziabad to Noida every day  says   I started working in Noida five years ago but wasn't staying there  Initially  I tried driving to work  but every trip used to cost me around Rs 400-450  Carpooling is not very popular or prevalent and I didn't know any other people who travelled to Noida so I used to take private buses  But they are very unreliable in terms of time  Earlier this year I heard about ride-sharing apps through which I got in touch with people who take the same route as I do  This gives me the option of travelling in a car instead of a crowded bus and the cost is shared among three to four people  which costs around Rs 150-200 per day  which is quite pocket-friendly </tech>

 <sports> ALCANIZ Spain: Spain's Jorge Lorenzo won his third race on home soil this season at the Aragon Grand Prix to cut the gap on Yahama teammate Valentino Rossi in the fight for the world championship to just 14 points     Rossi finished third as he failed to get passed Honda's Dani Pedrosa despite a series of attempts     However  defending world champion Marc Marquez's hopes of a third consecutive title are all but over as he crashed out on the second lap     For Marquez to clinch the title he would have to win each of the last four races  and Rossi and Lorenzo to hit a run of poor form     Marquez started on pole at his self-confessed favourite race after setting a blistering new track record in qualifying     However  he had already been overtaken by Lorenzo by the time he pushed too hard on the second lap and was unable to get his bike going again after running into the gravel      As always I made a good start  so my strategy was to ride at the maximum   said Lorenzo      I think it worked well because Marquez was at the limit to try and follow me  On the second lap I think he recovered some of the gap  but I didn't expect him to crash      When I saw that he had crashed I could breathe more deeply  Anyway I had Dani at between 2 7 and three seconds  but I couldn't open a bigger gap  I really needed to push all the race to keep this distance      Lorenzo was then allowed to ride easily to his sixth win of the season with the real action taking place behind him as Pedrosa bravely held off Rossi     The Italian passed Pedrosa on five occasions  but each time the Spaniard was able to respond immediately to prevent Rossi picking up an vital extra four points in the title race      It was really hard to focus on keeping the lap time but also closing the door because Vale was faster on many corners   said Pedrosa      I tried to fight  I tried to stay in front because I knew that was the key finish second  In the end  it was a good battle because I don't know how many times we overtook each other but it was nice to race to the end and finish second today      Nine-time world champion Rossi hasn't won a world title since 2009 and he was left to lament what could be an important four points lost come the final Grand Prix of the season in Valencia in November      I tried everything  but unfortunately Dani was able to overtake me in the next corner  After I would try another time but he was always able to come back   said Rossi      I knew it was difficult to beat Dani because he had very good pace  but I tried and I am not very happy because I needed that four points more for the second place  Today was not possible  but anyway it was a good result   </sports> <sports>  NEW DELHI: Former captain Sunil Gavaskar described Test skipper Virat Kohli as someone born to assume leadership role and hoped he will live upto the expectations of the people      He Kohli was born to lead  He led the under-19 team  and even as a player he was looking to learn from others  That is the big plus about Kohli that he learning  He makes mistakes  all of us make mistakes  But there is so much optimism with him becoming the captain  something which scares you  There is so much of expectations from the young man  it is sometimes scary but he will be upto it   Gavaskar said     Kohli today scored 103 runs and shared a 227-run partnership with opener Shikhar Dhawan 134 for the third wicket as India posted 375 all out  taking a substantial 192-run lead in the first innings of the first cricket Test against Sri Lanka at Galle     Sri Lanka were reduced to 5 for 2 in two overs in their second innings and Gavaskar said the hosts won't be able to save the match anymore      I don't think they will be able to recover  They might be able to save an innings defeat if they bat well and get a few partnership  Otherwise  I don't think they will be able to save the game  Only the weather can come to their rescue or else I think India is going to win with plenty of time to spare   Gavaskar said      I hope it is a three day thing  But Sangakkara is there and if he plays the innings of his life then it might stretch to the fourth day   he added     Asked about Kohli's ploy to open bowling with spinners R Ashwin  Amit Mishra and Harbhajan Singh  Gavaskar said:  It was top class thinking  I thought the way Ashwin was bowling  this is what he would try  Ishant at one end and Ashwin at other end  But with only four overs to go  he went with the spinners because in case it didn't work  the ball with still be hard enough for the new ball bowlers tomorrow      I think it is a tremendous move  Yesterday he might have missed a chip but that is the beauty of Virat Kohli  he keeps learning all the time   he told NDTV     Asked if Sri Lanka missed their skipper Angelo Matthews  who could not turn up to bowl as he had flu  Gavaskar said:  Yes  absolutely  When you lose your skipper  you lose direction      When the main man is not there  it does affect the team  Because they seemed bereft of ideas when Dhawan and Kohli were batting  But by the way Kohli and Dhawan were batting  I don't think even his presence would have mattered   said the former captain     Talking about Shikhar Dhawan  who got a couple of reprieves during his innings  Gavaskar said:  A century is a century  As a batsman  you get one chance often but he got a couple of chances today      When you get chances  you make the most of it and that's what he did  He went from 100 to 134 and at the end of it  these extra runs will make a difference between India batting in the second innings or batting for chasing not too many      Down the order  wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha  scored a steady 60 before being getting out in a debatable dismissal     Gavaskar said:  He Saha had this opportunity and he recognised it to do something  With the pitch playing a bit easier and Sri Lankan bowlers apart from Tharindu Kaushal not able to turn  he applied himself there and again those extra runs matter   @TOISportsNews  </sports> <sports> AUCKLAND: Riding on forward SK Uthappa's twin strike  the Indian men's hockey team

 <sports> LONDON: Mercedes will supply their power units to Formula One back-markers Manor Marussia next season in a deal announced on Thursday     Marussia  the smallest team in the sport  went into administration at the end of last season and survived only after a late rescue deal was put together  They have used Ferrari engines for the past two years     The new partnership comes amid a general shakeup of the engine landscape  with Renault set to buy Mercedes-powered Lotus and Red Bull's two teams negotiating with Ferrari after breaking from Renault     Champions Mercedes  whose engine is the most competitive in the sport  said the deal with Manor was a multi-year one and the units provided would be 'current year'      This new agreement should enable us to keep our supply roster at three customer teams for 2016  which is our ideal level in terms of technical and logistical capacity   said Mercedes High Performance Powertrains director Andy Cowell      We will be targeting gains in both performance and reliability for the 2016 Power Unit and look forward to delivering those to our new customers at Manor Marussia F1 Team      Mercedes also provide engines to Force India and former champions Williams as well as the works team of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg but have baulked at supplying arch-rivals Red Bull     Marussia principal John Booth said his team would resume a previous technical partnership with Williams Advanced Engineering for the supply of transmission and suspension components      Combined with Mercedes-Benz Power Units  we are very excited about the strength of our new powertrain package and what it means for the long-term future of our team   he said     Marussia have scored no points this season  after taking two last year with the late French driver Jules Bianchi in Monaco  Their drivers this season have been Britain's Will Stevens  American Alexander Rossi and Spain's Roberto Merhi     The 2014 points secured ninth place in the championship  ahead of Sauber and now-defunct Caterham  and prize money that has been crucial to the team's survival      Together with the potential we are seeing with our 2016 car in the wind tunnel  the Mercedes-Benz Power Unit will assist our return to aggressive performance development with effect from next season   said Booth  </sports> <politics>            MUMBAI: While celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary October 2 as anti-terrorism day  a section of community leaders and activists said India would have to reclaim the dreams of the Mahatma if it wants to usher in a completely non-violent  peaceful age  They also urged people to promote Hindu-Muslim unity    A dangerous mindset killed Mahatma Gandhi This mindset has survived in different forms till date  It is the same mindset which lynched a man in Dadri UP on mere suspicion of eating beef   said Abdur Rahman CH  general secretary Mumbai  Indian Union Muslim League IUML The IUML had marked October 2 as anti-terrorism day Many said that the real tribute to Gandhi would be providing justice to the weaker sections   When Dr B R Ambedkar framed the Constitution  he provided reservation for SCs and STs of all communities  but in 1954  a law was brought in that if a Hindu from SC/ST converted to another faith they would lose their SC/ST status and be denied reservation  This was the first instance of major injustice to Muslims in India   said Awami Vikas Party president Shamsher Khan Pathan  Consequently  said Pathan  Muslim presence in government jobs went from 30% in pre-Independence India to around 2% now  He also slammed the Congress for playing the soft Hindutva card and marginalizing Muslims for vote-bank politics   Observer Research Foundation Mumbai chairman Sudheendra Kulkarni said that Gandhi's satyagraha insistence on truth was the result of his close interaction with Muslims in South Africa   While the rest of India celebrated August 15  he was in Calcutta dousing the fires of communalism   he said  Senior community leader Ghulam Peshimam stressed the need to narrow Hindu-Muslim divide      </politics>
 <tech> Ultrasound -- inaudible sound waves normally associated with cancer treatments and monitoring the unborn -- may change the way we interact with our mobile devices     Couple that with a different kind of wave -- light  in the form of lasers -- and we're edging towards a world of 3D  holographic displays hovering in the air that we can touch  feel and control     UK start-up Ultrahaptics  for example  is working with premium car maker Jaguar Land Rover to create invisible air-based controls that drivers can feel and tweak  Instead of fumbling for the dashboard radio volume or temperature slider  and taking your eyes off the road  ultrasound waves would form the controls around your hand      You don't have to actually make it all the way to a surface  the controls find you in the middle of the air and let you operate them   says Tom Carter  co-founder and chief technology officer of Ultrahaptics     Such technologies  proponents argue  are an advance on devices we can control via gesture -- like Nintendo's Wii or Leap Motion's sensor device that allows users to control computers with hand gestures  That's because they mimic the tactile feel of real objects by firing pulses of inaudible sound to a spot in mid air     They also move beyond the latest generation of tactile mobile interfaces  where companies such as Apple and Huawei are building more response into the cold glass of a mobile device screen     Ultrasound promises to move interaction from the flat and physical to the three dimensional and air-bound  And that's just for starters     By applying similar theories about waves to light  some companies hope to not only reproduce the feel of a mid-air interface  but to make it visible  too     Japanese start-up Pixie Dust Technologies  for example  wants to match mid-air haptics with tiny lasers that create visible holograms of those controls  This would allow users to interact  say  with large sets of data in a 3D aerial interface      It would be like the movie 'Iron Man'   says Takayuki Hoshi  a co-founder  referencing a sequence in the film where the lead character played by Robert Downey Jr  projects holographic images and data in mid-air from his computer  which he is then able to manipulate by hand     Broken promises  Japan has long been at the forefront of this technology  Hiroyuki Shinoda  considered the father of mid-air haptics  said he first had the idea of an ultrasound tactile display in the 1990s and filed his first patent in 2001     His team at the University of Tokyo is using ultrasound technology to allow people to remotely see  touch and interact with things or each other  For now  the distance between the two is limited by the use of mirrors  but one of its inventors  Keisuke Hasegawa  says this could eventually be converted to a signal  making it possible to interact whatever the distance     For sure  promises of sci-fi interfaces have been broken before  And even the more modest parts of this technology are some way off  Lee Skrypchuk  Jaguar Land Rovers' Human Machine Interface Technical Specialist  said technology like Ultrahaptics' was still 5-7 years away from being in their cars     And Hoshi  whose Pixie Dust has made promotional videos of people touching tiny mid-air sylphs  says the cost of components needs to fall further to make this technology commercially viable   Our task for now is to tell the world about this technology   he says     Pixie Dust is in the meantime also using ultrasound to form particles into mid-air shapes  so-called acoustic levitation  and speakers that direct sound to some people in a space and not others -- useful in museums or at road crossings  says Hoshi     From kitchen to car   But the holy grail remains a mid-air interface that combines touch and visuals     Hoshi says touching his laser plasma sylphs feels like a tiny explosion on the fingertips  and would best be replaced by a more natural ultrasound technology     And even laser technology itself is a work in progress     Another Japanese company  Burton Inc  offers live outdoor demonstrations of mid-air laser displays fluttering like fireflies  But founder Hidei Kimura says he's still trying to interest local governments in using it to project signs that float in the sky alongside the country's usual loudspeaker alerts during a natural disaster     Perhaps the biggest obstacle to commercializing mid-air interfaces is making a pitch that appeals not just to consumers' fantasies but to the customer's bottom line     Norwegian start-up Elliptic Labs  for example  says the world's biggest smartphone and appliance manufacturers are interested in its mid-air gesture interface because it requires no special chip and removes the need for a phone's optical sensor     Elliptic CEO Laila Danielsen says her ultrasound technology uses existing microphones and speakers  allowing users to take a selfie  say  by waving at the screen     Gesture interfaces  she concedes  are nothing new  Samsung Electronics had infra-red gesture sensors in its phones  but says  people didn't use it      Danielsen says her technology is better because it's cheaper and broadens the field in which users can control their devices  Next stop  she says  is including touchless gestures into the kitchen  or cars  </tech>
 <tech>  WASHINGTON: Your tweets can tell how much you earn  suggests a new study which found that those with higher incomes tend to express more fear and anger on Twitter     Researchers from University of Pennsylvania  Johns Hopkins University  University College London and Microsoft Research started by looking at Twitter users' self-described occupations     In the UK  a job code system sorts occupation into nine classes  Using that hierarchy  the researchers determined average income for each code  then sought a representative sampling from each     After manually removing ambiguous profiles  the team ended up with 5 191 Twitter users and more than 10 million tweets to analyze      It's the largest dataset of its kind for this type of research   said Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro  a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania  who led the study     Researchers then created a statistical natural language processing algorithm that pulled in words that people in each code class use distinctly     Most people tend to use the same or similar words  so the algorithm's job was to  understand  which were most predictive for each class  Researchers analyzed these groupings and assigned them qualitative signifiers     Some of the results validated what is already known  for instance  that a person's words can reveal age and gender  and that these are tied to income  researchers said     The researchers also found that those who earn more tend to express more fear and anger on Twitter  Perceived optimists have a lower mean income     Text from those in lower income brackets includes more swear words  whereas those in higher brackets more frequently discuss politics  corporations and the nonprofit world      Lower-income users or those of a lower socioeconomic status use Twitter more as a communication means among themselves   said Nikolaos Aletras of University College London      High-income people use it more to disseminate news  and they use it more professionally than personally   he said     The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE  </tech> <tech> Along with refreshing its consumer desktops and laptops with Intel's new sixth generation Skylake processors  Lenovo is also giving its gaming systems a boost  Lenovo's game-centric PCs are branded under the IdeaCentre Y Series  and the gaming laptops fall under the IdeaPad Y Series     In addition to upgrading its hardware  Lenovo is also introducing new gaming peripherals  The company is rolling out a new mechanical keyboard  mouse and headset     IdeaCentre Y900 and Y700g   As part of Lenovo's new re-branding  the higher the series number means the better the specs  As such  the Y900 is the flagship IdeaCentre gaming desktop in the series     Both the IdeaCentre Y900 $1 599  &pound;1 039  AU$2 246 and Y700 $999  &pound;649  AU$1 403 are highly serviceable and upgradeable machines  featuring a chassis large enough to fit a full ATX motherboard  Both models feature processor selection up to a quad-core Intel Core i7 Skylake  but the Y900 features support for dual graphics cards accessible via a push lever that opens a second compartment     The Y900 also comes with dust filters that helps the fans stay clean to keep the system cool     IdeaPad Y700   Designed for gaming on the go  Lenovo says that the IdeaPad Y700 $949  &pound;617  AU$1 333 is made with the mobility of a laptop and the power of Intel's and AMD's latest processors  Gamers will also get to configure the IdeaPad Y700 with dedicated graphics options     The system also features QHD screen options in 15- or 17-inch sizes  A touchscreen is optional  as is the Intel RealSense 3D camera  At IDF 2015  Intel showed that the RealSense camera can be used to scan the people and objects  This way  you can have a 3D avatar of yourself in your game  or you can replace common game elements and customize compatible games with objects that you scan in with the camera     For immersive audio  there is a JBL speaker and subwoofer           Y Accessories New accessories to the Y Series include the Y Gaming Surround Sound Headset $69  &pound;44  AU$96  Y Gaming Precision Mouse $69  &pound;44  AU$96  Y Gaming Mechanical Switch Keyboard $139  &pound;90  AU$195 and Y Gaming Backpack $99  &pound;64  AU$139   The headset delivers 7 1 virtual surround sound  features a quick mute button and in-line volume adjustment  There is also a noise canceling microphone     class= gwt-Image  src= /photo/48804954 cms      Lenovo says that the mouse has eight programmable buttons  four levels of adjustable DPI  five levels of adjustable weights and adjustable speeds all packed into an ergonomic package  Lenovo also sells a waterproof Y Gaming Mouse Mat $9  pound </tech>
 <tech> Microsoft has announced that Power BI -- its tool for helping businesses make sense of their huge-and-growing storehouses of data without the help of an IT pro or developer -- will be generally available on July 24 though it's had plenty of customers using it in a paid preview for months now     Power BI was the first product released by Microsoft after CEO Satya Nadella after he took the reins last year  and he's repeatedly pointed to data management and analysis as a major focus area for the company  Since then  the company has promised that it was  tripling down  on the product     The opportunity here  says Power BI product leader James Phillips  is to establish Microsoft as the leader in cloud-based business analytics  a market where there isn't already a single runaway success story      We see it as an opportunity to grow the business analytics market by ten  a hundred  a thousand times   Phillips says     Salesforce came out of nowhere to dominate legacy players like Siebel with its browser-based customer relationship management CRM technology  and Workday may have disrupted PeopleSoft  but the same phenomenon just hasn't happened with analytics  Phillips says  Microsoft stands poised to make that happen     So while high-profile startups like Tidemark  Tableau  Good Data  and most recently Domo recently valued at $2 billion all claim to make it super-easy to take huge stores of data and visualize them  none of them have Power BI's ease of use  Phillips says     A major point of pride at Microsoft is that you can get started and get productive within 5 minutes of creating your Power BI account  creating charts and  slicing and dicing  your business data in cool and interesting ways  like so:     You can't do that with Domo   Phillips says   You just can't      Of course  larger companies have analytics products  too: Salesforce Wave and IBM Watson Analytics both do the same kind of thing  But once again  Phillips says that the ease-of-use is a major differentiator: Where those target the business analyst  Phillips says  Power BI is for the non-technical user anywhere in a company  That easy user interface is itself a big technological step forward  he says      It's years ahead of IBM Watson and Salesforce Wave   Phillips says     The other thing Power BI does well  Phillips says  is take advantage of the fact that Microsoft technology is everywhere in most enterprises  While Power BI can connect with data from the likes of GitHub  Salesforce  and plenty of others  it can also load up the statistical models from older Microsoft products like Excel and work with that   </tech>
